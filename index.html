            I don't really give a damn about<br>
            the way you touch me
            when we're alone <br>
            You can hold my hand
            If no one's home<br>
            Do you like it when I'm away? <br>
            If I went and hurt my body, baby <br>
            Would you love me the same?<br>
            <br>
            I can feel all my bones coming back <br>
            And I'm craving motion <br>
            Mama never really learns how to live by herself <br>
            It's a curse
            And it's growing <br>
            You're a pond and I'm an ocean <br>
            Oh, all my emotions feel like explosions <br>
            when you are around <br>
            And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh <br>
            <br>
            Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you <br>
            I need you here to stay,
            I broke all my bones that day I found you <br>
            Crying at the lake <br>
            Was it something I said to make you <br>
            feel like you're a burden? Oh, and if I <br>
            could take it all back <br>
            I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
            <br>
            Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa <br>
            I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no) <br>
            Listen close, it's a no <br>
            The wind is a-pounding on my back <br>
            And I found hope in a heart attack<br>
            Oh at last, it is past
            Now I've got it, and you can't have it <br>
            oh baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
            I need you here to stay <br>
            I broke all my bones that day I found you,
            Crying at the lake <br>
            Was it something I said to make you feel like <br>
            you're a burden, oh <br>
            And if I could take it all back <br>
            I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
            <br>
            Darling, when I'm fast asleep <br>
            I've seen this person watching me <br>
            Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth <br>
            it? Tell me, is it worth it?" Oh <br>
            <br>
            Guess there is something, and there is nothing <br>
            There is nothing in between <br>
            And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer <br>
            Watching over me, he's singing <br>
            "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy" <br>
            He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a <br>
            line without a hook" <br>
            <br>
            oh baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you <br>
            I need you here to stay <br>
            I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
            Crying at the lake <br>
            Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh <br>
            And if I could take it all back <br>
            I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>

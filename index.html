        I don't really give a damn about<br>
        the way you touch me
        when we're alone <br>
        You can hold my hand
        If no one's home<br>
        Do you like it when I'm away? <br>
        If I went and hurt my body, baby <br>
        Would you love me the same?<br>
        <br>
        I can feel all my bones coming back <br>
        And I'm craving motion <br>
        Mama never really learns how to live by herself <br>
        It's a curse
        And it's growing <br>
        You're a pond and I'm an ocean <br>
        Oh, all my emotions feel like explosions <br>
        when you are around <br>
        And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh <br>
        <br>
        Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you <br>
        I need you here to stay,
        I broke all my bones that day I found you <br>
        Crying at the lake <br>
        Was it something I said to make you <br>
        feel like you're a burden? Oh, and if I <br>
        could take it all back <br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
        <br>
        Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa <br>
        I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no) <br>
        Listen close, it's a no <br>
        The wind is a-pounding on my back <br>
        And I found hope in a heart attack<br>
        Oh at last, it is past
        Now I've got it, and you can't have it <br>
        oh baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
        I need you here to stay <br>
        I broke all my bones that day I found you,
        Crying at the lake <br>
        Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh <br>
        And if I could take it all back <br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
        <br>
        Darling, when I'm fast asleep <br>
        I've seen this person watching me <br>
        Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?" Oh <br>
        <br>
        Guess there is something, and there is nothing <br>
        There is nothing in between <br>
        And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer <br>
        Watching over me, he's singing <br>
        "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy" <br>
        He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook" <br>
        <br>
        oh baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you <br>
        I need you here to stay <br>
        I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
        Crying at the lake <br>
        Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh <br>
        And if I could take it all back <br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
